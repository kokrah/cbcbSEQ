\alias{log2CPM}
\title{Compute log2(quantile counts per mil reads) and library size for each sample.}
\usage{
log2CPM(qcounts, lib.size = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{qcounts}{quantile normalized counts}

\item{lib.size}{default is colsums(qcounts)}
}
\value{
list containing log2(quantile counts per mil reads) and library sizes
}
\description{
Performing a log2(cpm(quantile(counts))) of a count matrix is a quick way to get data ready for
visualization and analysis so that we may see trends more easily.  Unfortunately, that format is
inappropriate for any of the differential expression tools, ergo voomMod().
