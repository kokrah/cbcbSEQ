\title{hpgltools: a suite of tools to make our analyses easier}
\description{
This provides a series of helpers for working with sequencing data
}
\details{
It falls under a few main topics

\itemize{
\item Data exploration, look for trends in sequencing data and identify batch effects or skewed distributions
\item Differential expression analyses, use DESeq2/limma/EdgeR in a hopefully robust and flexible fashion
\item Ontology analyses, use goseq/clusterProfiler/topGO/GOStats in hopefully robust ways
}
