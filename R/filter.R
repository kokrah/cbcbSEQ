#' Filter low expression genes, using independent filtering
#' recommended in Nature Protocols paper
#'
#' @param counts Count matrix
#' @param lib.size library sizes, if missing or sum uses the total counts per samples
#' @param thresh Minimum counts per million to determine expression
#' @param minSamples Minimum number of samples where gene is required to be expressed. This should be set to the numer of samples in the smallest group of interest.
#' @return Filtered count matrix
